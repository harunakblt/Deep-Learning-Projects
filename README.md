📘 Overview
This repository highlights my hands-on experience with Deep Learning through a collection of projects and learning notebooks. Each project demonstrates the application of neural network architectures to solve practical problems. From foundational experiments to more complex implementations, this repository captures my progression and understanding across different deep learning tasks.

📂 Featured Projects
📚 00 - Learning Deep Learning
Introductory notebooks created during my learning phase, covering core concepts like perceptrons, activation functions, loss functions, and basic model building with TensorFlow and PyTorch.

💳 01 - Credit Score Classification
A multi-class classification project to predict credit scores (Good, Standard, Poor) using an Artificial Neural Network (ANN). The pipeline includes:

Data preprocessing & normalization

Model design with early stopping and dropout

Performance evaluation via Accuracy, Precision, Recall, and F1-Score

🦸🏻‍♀️ 02 - Avengers Character Detection (YOLOv11)
This project uses the YOLOv11 object detection algorithm to detect and classify Avengers characters from images. Highlights include:

Custom image dataset with 552 labeled images (6 characters)

Dataset split: 80% training, 10% validation, 10% testing

Tools: Roboflow for preprocessing & annotation

Evaluation based on detection accuracy and class-wise precision
